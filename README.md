### Projects
- MultiSite Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) Sleep Study October 2024-Present

  I am currently working with Dr Roy at Cook Children's Medical Center to examine the need for a baseline polysomnogram (PSG) prior to Growth Hormone (GH) initiation. We teamed up with three other hospitals (Children's Mercy Kansas City, Seattle Children's Hospital, and University of Utah Health) to collect all the data on PWS patients who had a baseline PSG younger than 2 years of age and prior to GH initiation from birth to 3 years of age. I cleaned, processed, and analyzed the various groups using Chi-Squared Test of Independence, Mann Whitney U Test, Kruskal-Wallis Test, and Wilcoxon Signed Ranked Test. This data was presented in a poster, as seen below, in May 2025 at the Pediatric Endocrine Society Conference and is awaiting publication.

  In this study, I retroactively examined pediatric PWS patients who received at least one Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS). Through this study, it was found that dysphagia was present in 100% of 1st VFSS and aspiration was noted in 38.9% of 1st VFSS. In all cases of aspiration in initial or subsequent VFSS, 100% were silent and presented no clinical signs.

  In this project, seen on my Github profile, I built a neural network in order to identify if an x-ray indicated a patient had pneumonia or was normal.

  In this project, seen on my Github profile, I used Random Forest to predict whether women would have gsetational diabetes or not. I found that despite numerous women missing their blood glucose levels in the data, which would otherwise be used to determine diabetes status, when replacing missing blood glucose with the mean for the overall population and when other factors were taken into account, this model was highly accurate in predicting the outcome as seen by the F1 and ROC AUC.

### A little about me... 
When I'm not working, you can find me with my pups on a hike, learning some new skills on Udemy or Coursera, painting, or working out at the gym. 

Me gusta practicar mi español y ver muchos cortometrajes en LingoPie. También me encanta encontrar hispanohablantes con quienes practicar español. (Es muy divertido!)
