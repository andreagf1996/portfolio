### A little about me... 
When I'm not working, you can find me with my pups on a hike, learning some new skill on Udemy or Coursera, painting, or working out at the gym. 

Me gusta practicar mi español y ver muchos cortometrajes en LingoPie. También me encanta encontrar hispanohablantes con quienes practicar español. (Es muy divertido!)
